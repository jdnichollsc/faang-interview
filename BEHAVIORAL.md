Few seconds later that co-worker complain me because he was gossiping and he understood something different, something like I had said that he was not doing anything. 
  - Task: Coordinate meetings with him and also with the team, including the boss.
  - Actions: I spoke with him in private, in order to clarify that I was helping to prioritize the tasks with the boss and I said he was blocked with a task because he's waiting response from the client. Then we had a meeting with the rest of the team to be transparent, discuss any concern and help to improve our communication.
  - Result: I tried to change that environment by being friendly with others, discussing everything with the team and commenting on aspects of improvement, giving them feedback on this situation and suggestions. Also I wrote an email for the team, inviting them to ask anything, in order to generate a safe environment for all, helping to develop confidence having a better communication with the team, to avoid gossip and conflicts between co-workers.
  - Problems: My boss wasn't very down to earth (Unrealistic requests).

### Did you have an opportunity to do this at your current job?
### How would a career at COMPANY_X help you grow as an engineer?
- Building a better, more connected world with the products we create
### Tell me about a situation when you failed. What did you learn from this?
- Perfect is the enemy of good:
  - Situation: The project's deadline was set in stone, delayed with one week sprints
  - Tasks:
    - Perform concept tests and technology assessments (Justify architectural decisions).
    - Elaborate architectural baseline for Reactive applications and integrate existing solutions for a Suite of products.
    - Help the architecture team to integrate the existing products together with the new services to meet the deliveries stipulated with the client.
    - Coordinate and plan each of the deliveries together with the Director and the Architecture team.
    - Evaluate new solutions for the agile development of the system.
  - Actions:
    - Research and compare Frameworks for reactive apps, define advantages and disadvantages, limitations and risks.
    - Use a commercial theme to reduce time to market and create a simple dashboard for reusability in a crucial time.
    - Upgrade the commercial theme to use the last version of MeteorJS in our products.
  - Results:
    - I spent a lot of time updating the theme to avoid code refactors in the future, in the end it was a success but I was tired and bored because I had invested a lot of my free time, incluiding weekends, replacing deprecated libraries and fixing the new structure of the project.
    - I updated the baseline for the development of applications through the use of new technologies for rapid prototyping with MeteorJS and NodeJS.
    - I developed quickly and under pressure the functionalities defined for each of the deliveries agreed with the client.
    - I configured continuous integration for new projects through cloud services such as Azure and Visual Studio Team Services.
    - I compared new technologies such as MeteorJS, GraphQL and Apollo Server with respect to the existing base lines in the company.
  - Problems:
    - Difficult to decompose a feature into small enough pieces to be consumed on a weekly basis.
    - Individuals in the team need to be good at managing their time and not letting it get consumed by meetings, tangential discussions etc.
### Tell me about a time when somebody changed your mind
- Good is better than perfect:
  - Situation: I used to be a perfectionist in my work, because there's trade-off between being agreeable and being execution oriented, when you move fast, you can be aggresive and frustrate the people who want to get things done too.
  - Result: I learned that you can keep iterating and make it better as well as you need instead of trying to make everything perfect the first time, to avoid frustration because nothing will ever truly be perfect.
### Tell me about a difficult problem you solved in the last six months
- Fixing non-scalable code (SmartAssist)
- Fix database transactions locking the database
### What's the most difficult/challenging problem you have had to solve?

  - Actions:
    - Investigate Open Source and commercial tools with better performance
    - Discuss with QA team about business formulas used in these exports.
    - Discuss with the team leader and defining contracts using interfaces to extract the logic to be implemented with another tool (Factory pattern and SOLID Principles, it seeks to maintain a system decoupled from the details of implementation)
  - Result: PoCs comparing performance with other tools, using an Open Source project to replace a deprecated commercial tool, contributing to fix issues with the help of the community and I was able to improve performance without a big refactor of the code that could affect the operation of the business.
### Can you give an example of a valuable piece of feedback that you have received?
- 360 degree-feedback:
  - Situation: Evaluate communication, responsibility, teamwork and relationships, elements which are important to be aligned with the culture of the company: purpose, autonomy, mastery and distributed intelligence.

      * I lead initiatives within the team. (Manages information and effort of a group of people, is responsible for the results obtained from a project).
      * I provide additional value to the work I deliver.
### When did you receive constructive/negative/difficult feedback? How did you act upon this?
- Anonymous feedback:
  - Situation: To achieve the best version of myself it is important to recognize the aspects in which I must improve, identify opportunities for our own improvement and provide ideas to our colleagues so they can perform better.
  - Task: Give feedback anonymously because it's usually more direct, since we are withdrawn from taking it personal when we are criticized.
  - Actions: Perform communication exercises. Define and execute actionable of the retrospective meetings.
  - Results:
    - I identified I need a more persuasive, clear and structured communication.
    - Taking trainings to be concrete; Identify fillers (remove repetitions).
    - Give some context and ask the other to know when to give more context.
    - Request little time to clarify an idea (Give me 2 secs, let me think, draw the problem).
    - Corroborate how much my interlocutor wants to know about the subject I am presenting.
    - Taking training sessions to generate a plan to avoid making the same mistakes.
### How would your co-workers describe you? Who is your favorite co-worker?
- Good aspects:
  - Constantly improving: Juan, I really highlight your willingness to collaborate. You are supportive, you have an admirable interest in learning and constantly improving on a technical level. I also want to highlight the effort you make to be understood and the humility with which you share your knowledge. You bring harmony to the team and you worry that there is a good atmosphere, you are participative and you take the voice when no one else seems to want to speak. You look for challenges and you are constantly expanding your comfort zone. You receive feedback with a very good attitude and you try to implement it. You care a lot for others (not only for your team but for people in general) and you have a great motivation to add value from what you do. Your level of self-awareness regarding what you can improve has increased considerably and I have shown progress regarding the strategies you have. I have seen improvement in your way of communicating and I recognize the effort that represents you.
- Aspects to improve:
  - Defend a position: Sometimes I think that you take things very personally when talking about a situation in which you are involved, remember what is being talked about is to improve the team, not so that you always go out to defend a position.
  - Effective communication: The challenge you have in your communication skills is to implement the strategies and be persistent because they require significant time for more effective communication styles to be automated. I have the impression that you privilege the use of your time to grow as a developer and that you see communication as something "additional" or "desirable but not fundamental" and by not seeing direct results so soon, your conscious effort decreases progressively. Your habits can improve a lot and I have the impression that you don't put in so much effort because you consider it secondary; But since we've discussed it so many times, this is vital for you to achieve even higher performance.
